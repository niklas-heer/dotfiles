# Dotfiles

![Screenshot](images/shell_03.png)

These dotfiles use [Dotbot][dotbot] for installation. <br/>
These dotfiles should also update automatically every once in a while. :wink:

## Installation

1. Clone this repo somewhere in your `$HOME`.
2. Run `make`.
3. Change you standard shell to `zsh`.
4. Change your `~/.gitconfig`.
5. Profit. :dollar:

> Note that the install script is idempotent, which means it can safely run multiple times.

You can append your environment after `make`. Like that: `make linux`. <br/>
The following environments are available:

| Command      |                                                                Desciption |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `make`       |                                                Make a basic installation. |
| `make linux` |                    It basically runs `make` and installs Linux specifics. |
| `make solus` | It basically runs `make linux` and installs software on Solus after that. |
| `make arch`  |  It basically runs `make linux` and installs software on Arch after that. |
| `make mac`   |          It setups macOS and installs software via `brew` and `brew cask` |

## Making Local Customizations

You can make local customizations for some programs by editing these files:

- `zsh` : `~/.zshrc_local_before` run before `.zshrc`
- `zsh` : `~/.zshrc_local_after` run after `.zshrc`
- `git` : `~/.gitconfig_local`

## Software needed

- `git`
- `zsh`
- `vim`
- `tmux`
- `tree`
- `python3`
- `python3-pip`
