## Project decision log
I want to document my decisions for me so I don't forget and potentially for you so you understand why I use one tool or another or why I remove stuff from time to time.

<!-- DECISION LOG START -->

### 0010 Adopting Ghostty
* **Status**: ‚úÖ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will use [`Ghostty`](https://ghostty.org/) instead of Wezterm, Kitty or iTerm.
* **Context**: Ghostty renders superfast. Has great configuration out of the box. Supports macOS-native APIs like passwords or Finder. But it also implements new things like the Kitty image protocol. I believe this is the best Terminal out there at this moment.
* **Consequences**: I get to use a great terminal. Maybe write a bit of config.

### 0009 Adopting oh-my-posh
* **Status**: ‚úÖ Adopted
* **Decision**: I use [`oh-my-posh`](https://ohmyposh.dev/) instead of [starship](https://starship.rs/) as my prompt theme engine.
* **Context**: OMP (oh-my-posh) also supports shorting the path name, like [powerlevel9k](https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k) could. (e.g., `~/.l/s/chezmoi`) It also lets you configure it in whichever format you like. (e.g., TOML, YAML, JSON) It also supports zsh and nushell so I can use it for both. But I guess it is in the end to that big of a difference, so it might come down to personal preference.
* **Consequences**: I have to write configuration.

### 0008 Keeping zsh as the login shell
* **Status**: ‚úÖ Adopted
* **Decision**: I leave `zsh` as the login shell.
* **Context**: Usually after using nushell as my main shell, I should also change my login shell via `chsh`, but that also means that the system will use that shell per default. To avoid any errors, I leave `zsh` as the default login shell, but set nushell in all applications I use (like Ghostty or Zed) as the standard shell for day-to-day use.
* **Consequences**: I have to keep a minimal zsh setup.

### 0007 Adopting nushell
* **Status**: ‚úÖ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will use [`nushell`](https://www.nushell.sh/) instead of zsh, fish or elvish.
* **Context**: I looked at zsh, fish and elvish as my main shell, but I decided on nushell because it treats command output as structured data rather than plain text, which enables powerful data manipulation and filtering capabilities. I can easily achieve many things with that, for which I would have needed other tools. Thus simplifying my setup. Also, I like the syntax more, as it feels modern and more consistent with great error messages and documentation. For me, I breaking POSIX isn't that big of a deal, as I can still use zsh in those cases, but for my day-to-day use, I want a modern shell syntax.
* **Consequences**: I will rewrite some zsh functions and configure nushell.

### 0006 Removing PyInfra
* **Status**: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Supersedes [0004 Adopt PyInfra](#0004-adopt-pyinfra)
* **Decision**: I will use `chezmoi` and a `Brewfile` instead of PyInfra.
* **Context**: After testing the installation on two machines, it didn't work. It broke because some apps were already installed, and I could use the `--force` flag of homebrew. On another occasion, Python didn't install properly. So I decided to solve it via using a [Brewfile](https://homebrew-file.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) and [chezmoi templates](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/advanced/install-packages-declaratively/). This doesn't require extra dependencies and is simpler and more reliable.
* **Consequences**: I will have to experiment with PyInfra on another project. I also might have to write some shell scripts to set up fonts.

### 0005 Adopting chezmoi
* **Status**: ‚úÖ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will use [`chezmoi`](https://www.chezmoi.io/) instead of dotbot to manage my dotfiles.
* **Context**: I looked into different ways to manage my dotfiles. I looked into Nix, but that is too rigid and complex for what I want. I looked into GNU stow and dotbot, but that didn't suit my needs. `chezmoi` supports encrypted secrets, templates, and multi-machine setups and is distributed via a single binary. Having just one command to set up your whole system, which installs the dotfiles manager too, is awesome. Also, chezmoi uses file copying, which prevents potential symlink-related system breakages.
* **Consequences**: I will have to add all my configuration to chezmoi and learn how to use it.

### 0004 Adopt PyInfra
* **Status**: ‚õî Deprecated by [0006 Removing PyInfra](#0006-removing-pyinfra)
* **Decision**: I will use PyInfra to install software.
* **Context**: As I need to install packages and I want to try out PyInfra as it seems cool compared to Ansible as I can just use Python.
* **Consequences**: I will have to make sure Python and the PyInfra are installed.

### 0003 Switch to markdown
* **Status**: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Supersedes [0002 Adopt asciidoc](#0002-adopt-asciidoc)
* **Decision**: I will switch to Markdown from asciidoc.
* **Context**: While asciidoc is great, the support for it on GitHub is not. [GitHub doesn't support the flagship feature `include` for years](https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1095). The checklists don't look great, and even the admonitions don't look good out of the box either. I could switch to GitLab, which would solve all the above problems, but I want to stay with GitHub as more people might find it here.
* **Consequences**: I will have to say goodbye to the great asciidoc features like lists, but I now don't seemingly work against what GitHub prefers.

### 0002 Adopt asciidoc
* **Status**: ‚õî Deprecated by [0003 Switch to markdown](#0003-switch-to-markdown)
* **Decision**: I will write asciidocs (adoc) instead of Markdown to document everything in this repo.
* **Context**: I think the asciidocs format is superior. Lists are easier as they don't rely on whitespace. You have powerful macros to do table of contents and admonitions (e.g., a note or a tip). But above all else, you can include other files.
* **Consequences**: Checklists might look worse on GitHub, and people might not be as familiar with it. Tooling might not be on par.

### 0001 Adopt decision logs
* **Status**: ‚úÖ Adopted
* **Decision**: From now on, I will write decision logs explaining why I took a decision so that others might learn from it, or I can reference it later.
* **Context**: I have been working on my dotfiles and choosing different tools, but never really explained why I choose one over another.
* **Consequences**: I will have to write those decision logs quite frequently. Thus, I should build/use tooling for it.

### 0000 Starting fresh
* **Status**: ‚úÖ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will abandon my previous dotfiles and start new.
* **Context**: I realized that I only used a fraction of the functionality I added over the years, but it was hugely complex. When I wanted to change my `repo` function in zsh it took me a good few minutes to find it. When I then went through the script folder, I noticed that I hadn't used any of it in the last few years. That, paired with the inkling to try some new technology, pointed me to start fresh to have a minimal setup again.
* **Consequences**: I will need to implement features again that worked before.

<!-- DECISION LOG END -->
