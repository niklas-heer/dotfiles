# How to write good Bash scripts?

- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `#!/bin/bash` it's [more portable](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21613044).
- Read [this guide](https://github.com/progrium/bashstyle) and follow it. Your scripts will be better.
- Use [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) as a linter.
